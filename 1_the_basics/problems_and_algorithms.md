# Problems and Algorithms

* Everything starts from a **RWP** *real world problem*
* The **RWP** is distilled into the *informal problem description*
* The problem description is then refined into the **Problem Specification**.
	* remove contradictions
	* remove any incompleteness
	* remove any vagueness
* **Algorithms** are a group of rules to get a desired outcome from a certain input. Conditions:
	* *finite description:* has be written in a finite text, and can be broken into elementary pieces called *steps*
	* *executable:* every step has to be executable.
	* *terminating:* has to come to an end after a specific number of steps
	* *deterministic:*
* An algorithm solves a class of problems and can be tuned by changing specific parameters.

# From Problem to (computer)-solution

To sum up:

1. The starting point is the *real world problem*
2. Through abstraction and concentration the problem is condensed down to the *problem description*
3. The description is then formalised into the *problem specification*
4. Based on the above, the *algorithm* is then developed.
5. The *algorithm* is then implemented in a *3GL* as a *program*.
6. The *program* is then *compiled* into a *machine program*
7. The *parameters* are supplied, and the end-result is returned.

* In cases of massive applications, proving the correctness of an algorithm/program becomes too expensive, and in some cases impossible. In such cases we revert to *testing*.
* Creating proper *documentation* is also an essential part of the workflow.

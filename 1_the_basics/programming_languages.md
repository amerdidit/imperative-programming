# Programming Languages
*	**Programming languages** provide the rules that a program must abide
* The **syntax** denotes the 'aesthetics' of a language.
	* the vocabulary
	* standards for the program's structure
* The **semantics** denotes the meaning of the vocabulary and commands provided by a programming language.
* Programming languages are strict, and will generally not tolerate deviations from the syntax and semantics.
* A computer's processor understanding only one programming language. The *machine language* is specific to each processor model.
* The *machine language* is written in binary, and is not meant for humans to write, and so a *translator* is needed.
* A *translator* is a program itself, that converts programs from one language to another.
* The first improvements were *assembler languages*, and its translator is called an *assembler*
* *High Level Programming Languages*, also called 3GLs *Third Generation Languages* are translated into machine language by *compilers*
* Due to the success of 3GLs, a lot were created with various pros and cons, leading to *Domain-Specific* Languages.
	* **FORTRAN** *FORmula TRANSlator* was mainly aimed at mathematical applications
	* **COBOL** *COmmon Business Oriented Language*, the name speaks for itself. Was aimed more at managing large datasets than doing complex calculations.
	* The dominating languages today are C++, C#, Java, C, ADA. (I'm basing that on my course-text. Looking at Github you will see that Javascript is the dominant language, followed by Ruby, and then Java, while Go is increasing in popularity and will probably replace Java and ruby sooner or later, *Clojure* and *Haskel* are also on the rise.) http://www.githubarchive.org/

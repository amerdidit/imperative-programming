### The Computer

#### Computer Architecture

* Pioneered by the *von-Neumann-Computer*
	* **Control Unit**
		* Heart of the computer
		* loads the program
		* decodes the instructions
		* interprets the instructions
	* **Arithmetic Logic Unit**
		* can do logical and arithmetic operations
		* forms the **CPU** together with the *control unit*
	* **Memory**
		* Saves information
		* 1 bit is the smallest element, saving binary information: `{0, 1}, {Low, High}, {Yes, No}`
		* To accommodate more than 200 characters, 8 bits (one *byte*)are needed.
		* The *byte* is used as the elementary unit for measuring memory.
		* The *address* points to the location of the saved data.
		* *Addresses* point to *cells* that have a fixed size, usually a byte.
		* **RAM** means that each cell in the memory has the same access time.
	* **Input**
	* **Output**
* The *von-Neumann-Principles*
	1. The computer is made up of the above 5 elements.
	2. The structure of the program is independent of the problem it is supposed to solve.
	3. Programs, Data, temporary- and end-results are all saved in the same memory.
	4. The memory is split into cells with equal capacity, that are numerated and addressed.
	5. Sequential instructions of a program are saved in sequential cells. Executing one of them increases the address-registry by one.
	6. GOTO-commands allow the deviation from point 5.
	7. The following needs to exist:
		* Arithmetic operations.
		* logical operations
		* transport instructions (in,output save, read data)
		* conditional GOTO-commands
	8. All data is recorded in Binary.

* The von-Neumann-Architecutre is a **SISDA**: *Single Instruction Stream, Single Data Stream Architecture*

#### Computersystems

* Hardware:
	* Input (keyboard, mouse, camera, ...etc)
	* Storage (HDD, SSD, CD, DVD)
	* Output (printer, screen, ...etc)
	* Transport (modem, ...etc)
* Software:
	* Applications
	* Operating Systems
	* Databanks
	* Compilers
	* Drivers

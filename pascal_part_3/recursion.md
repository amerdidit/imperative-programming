# Recursion

* Should not be used for very simple examples like where an iterative solution has similar comlexity.
* Recursion can be expensive on the runtimestack, for example: searching through a linear list where the worst case will be equal to the number of elements -> memmory heavy. Alternativly it makes a lot of sense for a binary search tree, as the depth is not so great.

# Choosing The Identifier

Should be as short as possible, but long enough to convey the meaning of the object or function.

* Should be verbose and related to the porblem being solved.
* Identifiers should be written in accordance with proper grammar and spelling.
* **Use CamelCase**
* **Constants are all UPPERCASE**
* **Type identifiers get a t in the beginning like: `tType`**
* use nouns for variables and constants
* use verbs for functions or procedures
* use adjectives or adverbs for booleans

## **Abreviations:**
* use when a verbose identifier becomes too long.
* should be easily understoof from the context, or generally.
* use standard abreviations if they exist
* should be easy to decode and to pronounce
* wordbeginning are more important than ending. constants more important than vowels.
* avoid creating similar identifiers as a result of abreviations.

# Comments

Comments are an important part of any program. A program lacking in comments, is a program lacking in quality.

* add the comments while you are coding, not as an afterthrought. Keep the comments up to date with codechanges.
* keep the comments conformed with the code layout.
* **At the top of the program desribe the problem this program is supposed to solve. A comment on input and output is also expected.**
* explain constants, types, and variables if they are not clear.
* complex statement blocks should get commented.
* for long control statements, leave a comment after the final `end` indicating the start and structure of the control statement.
* do <u>not</u> add useless comments like `i := i + 1; {erhoehe i um 1}` that only repeat the code.
* At important points in a code, the state of the program is described. for example: `{ At this point the field has been ... }`

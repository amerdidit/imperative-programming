# Introduction to Imperative Programming
	
## Pascal Part 1

### Introduction

Reminder/disclaimer: This course is not about teaching Pascal as much as it is about teaching the fundamentals of imperative programming.

*The workflow for writing a program:*
* Write "paper code", train your mind to simulate a computer.
* Use an *Editor* to write a code and save it to a *file*
* The *source code* is then checked for syntax and semantic errors by the compiler
* The compiler translated the code to machine-language.

### Program Structure

Syntax Diagrams were introduced along with PASCAL. 

**Principles of Syntax Diagrams:**
>The representation of a grammar is made of a set of syntax diagrams. Each diagram defines a *non-terminal*. There is a main diagram which defines the language in the following way: to belong to the language, a word must describe a path in the main diagram.
Each diagram has an entry point and an end point. The diagram describes possible paths between these two points by going through other *non-terminals* and *terminals*. Terminals are represented by round boxes while nonterminals are represented by square boxes.

**A very simple pascal program:**
````pascal
program VerySimple (output);
begin
	written ('Hello! Hope you enjoy learning to code!')
end.
````

* The above prgram is called VerySimple
* the identifier `output` indicated that the data output should go to *standardout*, usually the screen.
* The *decleration part* is empty in this case
* The *statemenet part* contains the output-instruction `writeln` which a *standard procedure* in pascal and doesnt need to be declared.

### Indentifiers

#### Objects in a pascal program: 

	* constants
	* types
	* variables
	* procedures
	* functions

They all need unique identifiers.

#### Pascals allows characterset:

**Letters**
````
A B C D E F G H I J K L MN O P Q R S T U V W X Y Za b c d e f g h i j k l mn o p q r s t u v w x y z
````
**Digits**

````
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
````

**Special Symbols**

````
+		- 		* 		/. 		, 		: 		;= 		<> 	< 		<= 	> 		>=:= 	.. 	^ 		'( 		) 		[ 		] 		{ 		}
````

**Reserved Words**

````
and array begin case const div dodownto else end file for functiongoto if in label mod nil not of orpacked procedure program record repeatset then to type until var while with
````

**The Syntax Diagram for an identifier:**

Note:  
* `LongWord` and `longword` are identical identifiers.
* Some pascal implementations only evaluate the first 8 characters of an identifier and in some cases: `FoooBaar` and `FoooBaario` are identical.
* **standard identifiers** are already defined. For example: `output` and `writeln`
* *identifiers*, *numbers*, and *reserved words* need to be seperated by either a whitespace or an end-line-character, called *seperaters*.
* **comments** are also valid *seperators*, althought the actual usecase is to leave behind useful information for the programmer. For example
````pascal
program SehrEinfach (output);{ 	Dies ist das erste Programm-Beispiel 
	im Kurs 1613 }begin	writeln ('Hallo! Viel Spa√ü beim Programmieren!')end.
````

### Numbers

Pascal supports two different types of numbers.

#### `integers`

* The limit to the number of digits allowed in an integer is imposed by the memmory cell.
	* 16 bit(2byte) would allow 2^16 integer numbers to represented.
	* Half of the representable numbers would be allocated to the positive numbers, including zero. The other half for the negative numbers.
	* `maxint` is a standard-identifier for the largest representable integer. for 15 bit systems, this would be: `2^15 - 1 = 32767`
	* All intergers lie in the interval: `I = [-maxint - 1, maxint]`

#### `real`

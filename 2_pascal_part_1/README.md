# Pascal (Part 1)

Reminder/disclaimer: This course is not about teaching Pascal as much as it is about teaching the fundamentals of imperative programming.

*The workflow for writing a program:*
* Write "paper code", train your mind to simulate a computer.
* Use an *Editor* to write a code and save it to a *file*
* The *source code* is then checked for syntax and semantic errors by the compiler
* The compiler translated the code to machine-language.

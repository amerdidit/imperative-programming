# Introduction to Imperative Programming

* A **Computer** is undementally a machine that can save data and do simple operations on them.
* The operations are executed very fast (millions per second)
* **Algorithms** are the step by step instructions with which those operations should get executed.
* A **programming lanugage** is the language in which the above algorithms are written.
* A collection of *algorithms* writen using a *programming language* is called a **program**
* Benifits of computers:
	* Speed
		* Allows the execution of complex algorithms in relatively small time.
		* There are limitations (solving a chess game for example)
	* High Data Storage Capacity
		* Can store millions of documents and retrieve them in a matter of nanoseconds
	* Reliability
		* Almost all failures are attributed to faulty algorithms, not the computer themselves.
	* Universality
		* The breakthrough is attribution to John von Neumann in 1945, who had the idea of saving the data and program on the same medium.
	

**The purpose of this course**

* Provide basic conceptual knowledge needed for various specializations.
* Provide some basic hands-on experience with coding.
* Use PASCAL to do the above. 
* Preach quality coding:
	* Good programming style
	* Testing
	* analytical quality assurance.

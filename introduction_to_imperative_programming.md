# Introduction to Imperative Programming
	
## The Basics 

* A **Computer** is undementally a machine that can save data and do simple operations on them.
* The operations are executed very fast (millions per second)
* **Algorithms** are the step by step instructions with which those operations should get executed.
* A **programming lanugage** is the language in which the above algorithms are written.
* A collection of *algorithms* writen using a *programming language* is called a **program**
* Benifits of computers:
	* Speed
		* Allows the execution of complex algorithms in relatively small time.
		* There are limitations (solving a chess game for example)
	* High Data Storage Capacity
		* Can store millions of documents and retrieve them in a matter of nanoseconds
	* Reliability
		* Almost all failures are attributed to faulty algorithms, not the computer themselves.
	* Universality
		* The breakthrough is attribution to John von Neumann in 1945, who had the idea of saving the data and program on the same medium.

### Problems and Algorithms

* Everything starts from a **RWP** *real world problem* 
* The **RWP** is distilled into the *informal problem description*
* The problem description is then refined into the **Problem Specification**. 
	* remove contradictions
	* remove any incompleteness
	* remove any vagueness
* **Algorithms** are a group of rules to get a desired outcome from a certain input. Conditions:
	* *finite description:* has be writen in a finite text, and can be broken into elemantary pieces called *steps*
	* *executable:* every step has to be executable.
	* *terminating:* has to come to an end after a specific number of steps
	* *deterministic:* 
* An algorithm solves a class of problems and can be tuned by changing specific parameters.
